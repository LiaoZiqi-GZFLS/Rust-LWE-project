# Challenge Overview

"In the burgeoning era of quantum computing, traditional cryptographic methods are under threat. Visionary scientists have developed new 'post-quantum' cryptosystems, one of which is based on the Learning With Errors (LWE) problem. LWE's security relies on the presumed difficulty of solving certain mathematical problems involving lattices.
